        Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers
        to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using
        a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by
        visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among
        alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the
        same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of
        2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and
        devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and
        smartphones. An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying
        products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or
        shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online
        shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy
        from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business
        (B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to
        browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images
        of the products, along with information about the product
        specifications, features and prices. Online stores usually enable
        shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or
        items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid
        method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit
        card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For
        physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships
        the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital
        audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to
        the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online retailing
        corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay.[1] One of the earliest
        forms of trade conducted online was IBM's online transaction processing
        (OLTP) developed in the 1960s, which allowed the processing of financial
        transactions in real-time.[2] The computerized ticket reservation system
        developed for American Airlines called Semi-Automatic Business Research
        Environment (SABRE) was one of its applications. There, computer
        terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large
        IBM mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously and
        coordinated them so that all travel agents had access to the same
        information at the same time.[2] At some point between 1971 and 1971,
        students at Stanford and MIT used the internet precursor ARPANET to make
        a deal to exchange marijuana, but the interaction doesn't qualify as
        e-commerce because no money was transferred online.[3] The emergence of
        online shopping as it is known today developed with the emergence of the
        Internet.[4] Initially, this platform only functioned as an advertising
        tool for companies, providing information about their products. It
        quickly moved on from this simple utility to actual online shopping
        transaction due to the development of interactive Web pages and secure
        transmissions.[5] Specifically, the growth of the Internet as a secure
        shopping channel has developed since 1994, with the first sales of
        Sting's album Ten Summoner's Tales.[6] Wine, chocolates, and flowers
        soon followed and were among the pioneering retail categories which
        fueled the growth of online shopping. Researchers found that having
        products that are appropriate for e-commerce was a key indicator of
        Internet success.[7] Many of these products did well as they are generic
        products which shoppers did not need to touch and feel in order to buy.
        But also importantly, in the early days, there were few shoppers online
        and they were from a narrow segment: affluent, male, 30+. Online
        shopping has come a long way since those early days and – in the UK –
        accounts for significant percentage (depending on product category as
        percentages can vary).
